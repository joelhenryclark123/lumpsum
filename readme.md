# Lumpsum
I built this app to budget my padnemic unemployment insurance check, which came retoractively in a lump sum.

## Use
1. Enter your lump sum at the top
2. Enter expenses
3. See remainder at the bottom

## Technology
This is my first app with SwiftUI 2.0. I only used a few files, so it's pretty easy to navigate. 

Just check out the Lumpsum directory!
